# User story title: Reviews

User can add reviews in regard to product and quality and service of goods.

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: Low 
The priority for this system is low because it doesnt affect the idea of the app being a food delivery service, While having a review system is important for user satisfaction the app will run fine without reviews

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Dean: 2 days
* Nick: 4 days
* Gurjas: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):
- After a order/purchase is made users will be able to rate their product 1-5 stars and also their service 1-5 stars.
- Reviews/ratings will be put into a database 


## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.


Description-v1: The web site will allow users to review orders based on quality and service on a 1-5 star scale with 5 being the highest.

## Tasks, see chapter 4.
