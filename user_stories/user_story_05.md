# Tracking orders

## Priority: Medium (20)
Whilst not essential to the functionality of the application to users, it would greatly improve the experience of the app and should be implemented in the first milestone.

## Estimation: e.g. 5 days
* Nick: 4 days
* Dean: 5 days
* Gurjas: 5 days

## Assumptions (if any):
* When a user successfully places an order, he/she should be able to track the status and location of it

## Description:
Description-v1: FeedMe customer's will be able to track placed orders

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Create tracking page in application, Estimation 2 days
2. Add location tracking and business tools, Estimation 2 days
3. Test and remove bugs, Estimation 1 day
